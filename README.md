#The SQL seems to be very picky when searching the database - especially because of the date and time. Please do check the log
   if nothing shows up on the results page; if we receive a non - empty response it should definitely show up on the page.
   If nothing shows up that means the SQL did not find a match and the log will show that it returned an empty string. In other words,
   screen 9 and screen 10 has been implemented so that only matches show up; if there are no matches nothing will show up at all.

#In maps part you can drag and drop the pin and the location will be shown in the text area above.
